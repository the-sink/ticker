A simple command-line stock market earnings tracker.

This tool is extremely simple: it's a single script that lets you record shares of any given stock at a specific price, and track how much you have earned/ lost at the current point in time based on those share prices. This was created because I wanted a way of tracking stocks I already own outside of the investment firm I use, and all I could find was stock market simulators (probably could've looked more thoroughly - but who even *does* that??)

To use, clone the repository and run ``npm install`` in the working directory to retrieve the required dependencies, followed with ``npm start``.

**This tool does not conduct any real transactions**. It's just for tracking earnings.
